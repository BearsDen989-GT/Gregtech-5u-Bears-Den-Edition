# GT5-Unofficial  
This GT5 Repo contains a Modified version of GT5.08.33.  
This version is from Alkalus to be modified further for Bear989.
This is to have a working baseline for all our modifications.

# Changes  
Things not added in this fork include:  
Advanced Miner 2 Multiblock  
Diesel Generator Multiblock & Multiblock Turbine casing changes  
Assembly Line Multiblock  
Oil Cracker Multiblock  

GT Bees (Use Gendustry || Binnies, save time)  
GT Crop changes (I was/am tempted to remove crops entirely)  
GT Titanium Processing chain (The game is grindy enough without the need for extra realism)  
GT Plastics/Rubber Processing Chain (Default is better for my players, cannot add it anyway without a server reset and the addition of oil cracking)
